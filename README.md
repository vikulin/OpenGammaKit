**OpenGammaKit** is an open-source gamma spectrometer hardware platform, inspired by the excellent [Open-Gamma-Detector](https://github.com/OpenGammaProject/Open-Gamma-Detector). It takes the original schematic and redesigns the PCB using **KiCad** (originally designed in EasyEDA), making the project more accessible and modifiable for open hardware enthusiasts.

OpenGammaKit is designed to be affordable, reliable, and easy to integrate with embedded systems, mobile devices, or PCs—ideal for DIY nuclear instrumentation, educational labs, or citizen science.

## Spectrum of ²⁴¹Am source measured with NaI(Tl) detector
| Element | Symbol | Atomic Number | Mass Number |
|---------|--------|----------------|--------------|
| Americium | Am     | 95             | 241          |

The spectrum clearly shows two gamma peaks at **59.54 keV** and **26.35 keV**, both corresponding to emissions from ²⁴¹Am:

- The **59.54 keV** peak is the most intense and commonly used for energy calibration.
- The **26.35 keV** peak is weaker but still visible, depending on detector resolution and shielding conditions.

> 📌 These lines are useful for calibration and spectral identification in low-energy gamma spectroscopy using NaI(Tl) detectors.
